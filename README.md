# ShoppingWebsite
Simple Christmas-themed shopping website. This website is not a *real* shopping site, meaning no payment functionality.

For total website funcionality, you must run a web server on your local device. To do this:

1. have Node.js installed
2. download the project folder
3. navigate to the /src folder within the project in a command prompt
4. run "node ./server.js" in the command prompt
5. go to localhost:8080 in any browser to view the website
